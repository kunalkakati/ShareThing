# ShareThing

ShareThing is a site designed especially for colleges. It provides easy access to blogs, entities, topics, and other content posted by students within the college. As it is only available to college students in one particular college, students can discuss problems they have faced and find solutions. Additionally, the college can notify students about upcoming events, exams, and other activities through this system overriding the traditional notification system.
